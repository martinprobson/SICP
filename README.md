# SICP Notes

Notes, exercises and sample code I wrote whilst studying, *The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*
(Second Edition)
[The official website is here](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/ "MIT SICP Official website") 
and a nice HTML formatted version is [here](http://sarabander.github.io/sicp/) 

The example code is written in [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/ "Racket website")
